# LLM RAG Study Helper

This is a lightweight, rapid prototype of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tool that leverages a language model to help streamline studying for exams. Built in just one evening, this project uses a basic LLM with retrieval capabilities to answer questions based on external sources, focusing specifically on exam-related topics.

**Note:** Much of the code was generated with the help of AI, while the design decisions and debugging were handled manually. This is intended as a quick prototype rather than a production-grade solution.

## Features

- Basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for contextual question answering
- Simple, fast setup aimed at exam preparation and quick study sessions

## Installation

Since there is no `requirements.txt` file, you can install the dependencies one by one. Simply try running the script, and install any missing libraries as they appear in error messages:

```bash
pip install library_name
```

Repeat this until the script runs without errors.

## Running the Project

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JustAGuy/llm-rag-study-helper.git
   cd llm-rag-study-helper
   ```

2. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. Follow on-screen instructions to input questions or topics you'd like help studying. The model will retrieve relevant information and generate answers based on available resources.

## Notes

- **Purpose**: This project is intended as a study aid. Its responses are generated by a basic LLM and may not always be perfectly accurate, so it should be used as a supplement rather than a primary source of information.
- **Development**: As this is a quick prototype, error handling and optimization are minimal.

## Future Improvements

- Create a `requirements.txt` for easier installation
- Enhance retrieval techniques and add fine-tuning for study-specific topics
- Improve response accuracy with additional QA filtering

## Human Note
This code and readme are almost completely generated by AI and then manually edited when necessary.
One of the goals of this very small project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of AI in generating 
code and documentation combined with human oversight to ensure quality and accuracy.
